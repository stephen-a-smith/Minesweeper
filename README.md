# Minesweeper
In Progress - Minesweeper in Java

Minesweeper is one of my favourite games, and so I figured it would be good practice to create my fully featured implementation.

This is my second time creating a Minesweeper game in Java, the first being a summative project for Java 2 in College. This time I am using Gradle to make building and distribution easier, as well as cleaning up some mistakes I made the first time.

# TODO 

- Add Real Graphics
- Add Seeded Board Generation
- Add P2P Multiplayer (?)
